## Gameplay Tips

- Time your jumps carefully - you can clear 2 obstacles with one jump
- Watch for patterns in obstacle placement
- Moving platforms are safe to land on
- The game speeds up gradually - stay focused!
- Your best score is saved locally

## Difficulty Progression

The game now features an extremely gentle learning curve:

- **0-40m (Learning)**: Only simple spikes, very slow speed, huge spacing (500px)
- **40-80m (Easy)**: Still just spikes, slightly faster
- **80-120m (Normal)**: Blocks introduced, moderate speed
- **240-320m (Medium)**: Moving platforms appear
- **320-400m (Hard)**: Rotating saws added, challenging speed
- **400m+ (INSANE!)**: All obstacles including poop, maximum challenge

Key Features:
- Obstacles start 800px away (plenty of reaction time)
- Spacing decreases by only 5px per level (very gradual)
- No moving objects until 240m (level 6)
- Minimum spacing is 250px (always manageable)

## Customization

### Adjusting Difficulty
Edit these values in `js/game.js`:
- `jumpPower`: Jump height (default: -14)
- `gravity`: Fall speed (default: 0.8)
- `speed`: Initial game speed (default: 3.5)
- `maxSpeed`: Maximum speed (default: 12)
- `obstacleSpacing`: Initial distance between obstacles (default: 500px)
- `minObstacleSpacing`: Minimum spacing at high difficulty (default: 250px)
- `speedIncrement`: Rate of speed increase (default: 0.0004)
- `lastObstacleX`: First obstacle distance (default: 800px)

{"id":"GAME-3","title":"Fix broken collision detection for spikes and platform undersides","description":"Fixed critical collision detection issues:\n\n1. Platform collision logic completely rewritten:\n   - Now properly detects hitting platforms from below/sides (causes death)\n   - Only safe when landing on top with downward velocity\n   - Added safety check for players already on platforms\n\n2. Spike collision improvements:\n   - Added narrower collision box (20px instead of 30px) to match triangle shape\n   - Centered collision box with 5px offset\n   - Applied to both regular and simple spike generation\n\n3. Debug mode added:\n   - Set debugMode = true to visualize collision boxes\n   - Green box shows player hitbox\n   - Red boxes show obstacle hitboxes\n\n4. Fixed isColliding function to support custom collision boxes","acceptance_criteria":"All obstacles should have proper collision detection:\n- Spikes kill on any contact\n- Platform tops are safe to land on\n- Platform undersides and sides kill on contact\n- Blocks and other obstacles kill on any contact","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-22T19:46:16.761879-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T19:46:21.211319-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-22T19:46:21.211319-07:00"}
